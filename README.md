# About Me

My expertise spans full-stack development and design, with a strong focus on **Next.js**, **React**, and **WordPress**. Alongside this, I bring experience in creating **interactive maps**, **SEO**, **analytics**, **email marketing**, and **system administration**.  

When it comes to collaboration, I‚Äôm especially drawn to projects that address real-world challenges‚Äîdigital platforms that benefit from modern tooling, interactive features, or smart business tools to empower mission-driven teams.

Learning never stops for me. I‚Äôm continually deepening my knowledge of modern web technologies and infrastructure. My current stack includes **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **WordPress**, **Docker**, **AWS**, and **Google Cloud**, and I‚Äôm always eager to refine and expand it further.
